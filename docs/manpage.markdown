# NAME

loopdub - live audio loop manipulation

# SYNOPSIS

loopdub \<folder\> [outputfile]

# DESCRIPTION

LoopDub allows simultaneous mixing of several audio loops of the same
length, to be manipulated using an external MIDI controller.  It is
intended for live performance of loop-based music.

Please see the included README and website for keyboard commands and
instructions on how to set up your loops.

# OPTIONS

\<folder\>
: A folder containing loop files and possibly a program
configuration file.

[outputfile]
: An optional filename to write raw audio data to, for recording
purposes.  Note that this feature is not yet very robust, and it is
recommended to use other techniques for recording your set.
