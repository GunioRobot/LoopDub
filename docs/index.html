<h1>LoopDub</h1>

<p>Welcome to LoopDub, an audio application for live loop manipulation.
<p><h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be used with a MIDI controller.  Typically designed for something
like the Editor PCR-30, which has 8 sliders and 8 knobs as well as a 30-key
keyboard.
<li>Play and manipulate up to 8 loops.
<li>"Wait" button for dropping a channel into the mix on beat.
<li>Live low-pass and delay filters.
<li>Live jamming with the keyboard.
<li>Looping smaller parts of each loop on beat.
</ul>
<p><i>Important:</i> please read this WHOLE document before you give up!  It's
not difficult to use, I promise.

<h3>Getting LoopDub</h3>
<p>The current version of LoopDub can be downloaded <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=132786">here</a>.  It is currently only
working on Linux, but the next version will support Windows.  See the INSTALL
and README documents in the release for instructions on how to get it working.

<h3>Running LoopDub</h3>
<p>If it has been installed correctly (See INSTALL), you can run loopdub by
typing "loopdub" into a command-line, with the directory of your loops as the
argument:
<p><tt># loopdub /home/me/myloops/</tt>
<p>Personally I have created a launcher on my GNOME desktop to do this for me,
but the installer does not do this.

<h3>Audio set-up</h3>
<p>The output of your soundcard is split in two, for two-channel mono sound.  One side is used as the master out, and the other side is used for Cue.  I use
RCA splitter cables to get sound into both channels on the mixer.  Like so:
<p align="center"><img src="diagram.png">
<p>In the future LoopDub will likely support more configurations, like using
a second soundcard for the queue, or an extra channel on a multichannel
soundcard.  An option for having stereo sound and not using a cue channel
is also in the works.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Just a quick breakdown until I have time to write more extensive
documentation:
<h4>Top controls</h4>
<p><b>Beats:</b> click on this until it reads the correct number of beats
in your loop.  Then corresponding BPM will be displayed next to the button.
<p><b>Autocue:</b> when checked, the "cue" button will automatically be
selected when a new file is loaded.
<p><b>VU Meter:</b>Shows the current amplitude of final output signal.
<p><b>Master Volume:</b>Adjust this slider when VU Meter is very close to the
top, otherwise clipping may occur, which doesn't sound very nice.
<p><b>Learn:</b> After selecting your midi input device, click this button
to "learn" which controls are for what.  A sequence of controls is highlighted,
and you move the corresponding control on your MIDI keyboard to teach LoopDub
which function it corresponds to.  At the moment I usually use my sliders
for volume and my knobs for effects.  This means I am currently not using
4 of the knobs.
<h3>Loop controls</h3>
<p><b>Cue:</b> Puts the loop on the cue channel.
<p><b>Split:</b> Divides the loop into smaller pieces.  These splits are used
for a couple of different things.  You can click and drag on the loop with
your mouse to select a sequence of "parts" to be looped instead of the whole
thing.  This can be useful for changing how a beat sounds or looping a strange
voice clip.  Also, the "Wait" function will drop the sound back in on the next
split boundary, which is useful if you don't want to wait until the end of the
loop.
<p><b>Keys:</b> Chooses this loop as the "key" loop.  Only one loop can be
chosen at a time.  When any loop is chosen as the key-control loop, it will
no longer be played along with the other loops.  Instead, it will be triggered
when you press keys on your keyboard, at the correct pitch.  This allows you
to play melodies in realtime along with the other loops.
<p><b>Wait:</b> Cuts the volume on the loop until the next split boundary.
This is useful when you are cueing a track and want to have it come in on a
particular bar instead of manually having to throw the volume slider.  Once
you click "wait", you can move the volume slider into position without
affecting the output, and it will come in when the position indicator hits
either the next split boundary or the beginning of the loop.
<p><b>Norm:</b> This will normalize the loop.  Useful if you've forgetten to
do this beforehand.  Sometimes a quiet sample will have difficulty competing
with the rest of the sounds in the mix.
<p><b>Break:</b> This is not yet implemented, but it will allow you to use the
keyboard to trigger the loop from within different parts, based on the current
split configuration.  In other words, you will be able to re-sequence a
breakbeat or whatever you want, in realtime.

<h3>Keyboard commands</h3>
<p><b>Numbers 1 - 8:</b> Pressing numbers 1 through 8 on your keyboard, you
will notice that the corresponding loop number turns to a blue background. This
means that this loop sample is selected for being modified by MIDI controls.
You may also select or deselect a loop using a key on your MIDI keyboard, as
long as no loops are selected as the "key control" or "break" loop.  It is
known that there is not yet a configuration for MIDI channels, this is on the
TODO list.
<p><b>Enter: </b> Starts and stops audio output.
<p><b>Alt-Enter: </b> Toggles fullscreen mode. (Very nice for live sets, try it!)
<p><b>Escape: </b> Exits LoopDub.

<h3>Known issues</h3>
<p>There are many things that need to be changed and improved and added to
LoopDub, however I will list a couple here that are imperative that users know
about:
<ul>
<li>All loops must be the same size.  This is not strictly true, but there is
not currently any kind of realtime resampling or timestretching, so the first
loop loaded sets the <i>length</i> for the loops, and every subsequent sample
will be looped at the same tempo.  In other words, when the position counter
gets to the end of the first loop, it wraps back to the beginning for ALL
loops.  This is not really a problem for me since I use the same program to
generate all my loops, and I simply make them all the same size anyways (I find
that about 32 to 64 bars is good), but it an issue that needs to be addressed.
<li>All loops must be in the base loop folder specified on the command-line.
This is actually more of a feature than a bug.  I was doing a show where I
accidentally browsed out of my loop folder, and I got lost in my harddrive and
it ended up causing big problems, so I made it so that it is impossible to
browse outside the folder specified as your loop folder.  This will hopefully
avoid any of these kinds of problems.  The trick to using LoopDub is having a
well-organized loop folder.
<li>It does not currently remember your MIDI settings, nor does it let you
specify your MIDI channel for using the keyboard.  This may cause difficulties,
and I'm going to fix it as soon as possible.  Still, you may try MIDI anyways.
It works fine for me, but other keyboards may vary.  For your reference, my
MIDI keyboard is the Editor PCR-30.
</ul>
