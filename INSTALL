** Installing LoopDub **

** REQUIRED LIBRAIRIES:  PortAudio v.18, libSDL

On this version, I have switched to the autotools system for Unix-like
operating systems.  You will noticed that PortMidi is included in a zip
file in the source folder.  I did this because I use the Debian distro,
and it seems that although PortAudio and SDL are available through apt-get,
PortMidi is not.  However, the configure script is made to conveniently unzip
and compile PortMidi for you.

So, to compile LoopDub:

# ./configure
# make

And to install:

# make install

For extra options, try
# ./configure --help

If you wish to try it without installing it to your system, LoopDub is
pretty-much self-contained and can run from the source directory after
calling make.

# ./loopdub /path/to/loops


** Running LoopDub **

The program takes one optional argument, which is the folder where your loops
are stored.  For quick access, I keep mine right in the root folder, at /loops/
This is probably bad practise.. ;-)   But I execute it like this:

# loopdub /loops

If you keep your loops elsewhere, run it with a different path argument.
