** Installing LoopDub **

** REQUIRED LIBRAIRIES:  PortAudio v.18, libSDL

I used a perfectly normal Makefile for this project.  You will noticed that
PortMidi is included in a zip file in the source folder.  I did this because
I use the Debian distro, and it seems that although PortAudio and SDL are
available through apt-get, PortMidi is not.  However, the Makefile will
conveniently unzip and compile PortMidi for you.

So, to compile LoopDub:

# make

And to install:

# make install

It executes install.sh using "sudo".  If you don't have sudo installed, you may
execute install.sh yourself as the root user.  On the otherhand, if you are
using a system where you don't have access, you can run the program directly
from the source directory:

# ./loopdub

You may also use "make install" but change the installation location.  Edit
the Makefile and change the variables "PREFIX" and "LAUNCHER_PREFIX".

Currently PREFIX is /usr/share, and is the folder where loopdub gets installed.
LAUNCHER_PREFIX is the folder where a small launch script is created that you
can execute from anywhere.  (For some silly reasons, loopdub must be executed
from the folder containing its font file, so the launcher script cd's to the
install directory and runs it.)  It defaults to /usr/bin.

The only compile-time option is to change the look-and-feel of the GUI.  I got
bored of a standard 3D button-style interface and changed the look of them,
but you can use it by specifying FLAT_GUI=0 on the command line of the gui
folder's make:

# cd gui; make FLAT_GUI=0
# cd ..; make

Note: I am not using autoconf because I don't know how.  I'll get into it
one day, but if anyone feels like telling me how to set that up, it would
be cool.


** Running LoopDub **

The program takes one optional argument, which is the folder where your loops
are stored.  For quick access, I keep mine right in the root folder, at /loops/
This is probably bad practise.. ;-)   But I execute it like this:

# loopdub /loops
