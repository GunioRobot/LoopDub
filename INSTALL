== Installing LoopDub ==

The bootstrap.sh script is made to conveniently download and compile
dependent libraries if they are not commonly available for your
system.  So, when connected to the internet, the first step is to
execute it:

  # ./bootstrap.sh

Now, to compile LoopDub:

  # ./configure
  # make

LoopDub is pretty-much self-contained and can run from the source
directory after compiling.

  # ./loopdub /path/to/loops


== Running LoopDub ==

The program takes one optional argument, which is the folder where your loops
are stored.  For quick access, I keep mine right in the root folder, at /loops/
This is probably bad practise.. ;-)   But I execute it like this:

  # loopdub /loops

If you keep your loops elsewhere, run it with a different path argument.  The
path may contain an optional file called "programs.ini" which informs LoopDub
about how you want to respond to program-change MIDI messages.  It gives each
program a name, a folder (which should be relative to the loops folder), and
a list of loops associated with that program.  (For now, up to 8 loops per
program.)

See the included file, programs.ini.example for details.

There is also a configuration file called ".loopdub.midi.conf" which should
go into your home folder.  It contains mapping information between MIDI controls
and what GUI control they modify.  In fact, this can easily be generated at
runtime by clicking on "Learn", however the mode buttons cannot be configured
automatically.  See the included example file.  (It is a dot-file so if you
don't see it, try "ls -a".)
