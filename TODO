-- TODO --
Why are there still audio underruns when a file is loading?? (Threading should have fixed it... maybe set priority of file loading thread lower.)
Support for different soundcard configurations, using stereo, etc.
Fix ghosting on position indicators
Fix noise generated when changing echo delay length
Ensure mutex isn't locked during normalize operation
Filenames in alphabetical order
Rename Wait to.. Hold?
Save & load MIDI control & channel settings
Output MIDI clock
Effect selection via keyboard (check, select channel instead TODO: fix midi code to reflect this)
Port to windows
Envelopes for volume and other effects
Resampling / how to deal with differing loop sizes
More effects / DSP
 - delay/cross delay (check, but there are some artifacts)
 - distortion
Implement better effect class architecture
Ability to render to another sample
Move file-related code to background thread (done for files, needed for folders?)
Ability to play sample from keyboard overtop of loops (check)
 - or retrigger loops on demand, keep it on beat (quantized)
Improve time wasted during screen refresh -> more accurate UpdateRectangle()?
Small-ish user manual?
Apply for sourceforge project
Name for GUI library?


-- DONE --
Implement cue button (check)
Program cutoff filter (check)
Directories in file selector (check)
Half/quarter looping (check)
Deal with longer directory listings (check)
Threading synchronization between GUI sliders and use of values in audio rendering --> potential future problems (check)

fixed so argument provides base directory, which file browser cannot browser out of.  (problem during set!)
fixed file offset for browsing large directories
