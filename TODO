-- Roadmap --

Planned for v0.4:
  Output MIDI clock
  Filenames in alphabetical order
  Resampling / how to deal with differing loop sizes (Likely just retrig on beat)
  MIDI "pick-up" - don't change slider value under MIDI knob passes current value
  Optional stereo support

Planned for v0.5:
  Ability to render or mixdown to another sample
  Retrigger loops on demand, keep it on beat (quantized)  
  Output MIDI loops loaded from disk
  Clean up loopdub.cpp: Too large and complex!

Planned for v0.6:
  Record loops from a microphone or external equipment
  Record MIDI loops

Future:
  Implement better effect class architecture? Support external DSP?
  Envelopes for volume and other effects

-- Small bugs & issues --
Support for different soundcard configurations, using stereo, etc.
Fix ghosting on position indicators
Fix noise generated when changing echo delay length
Is mutex necessary? Disabled for now, seems to have no ill effects

-- DONE --
Implement cue button (check) (disabled for now, is it useful?)
Program cutoff filter (check)
Directories in file selector (check)
Half/quarter looping (check)
Deal with longer directory listings (check)
Threading synchronization between GUI sliders and use of values in audio rendering --> potential future problems (check)
Move file-related code to background thread (done for files, needed for folders?)
Improve time wasted during screen refresh -> more accurate UpdateRectangle()?
Ability to play sample from keyboard overtop of loops (check)

fixed so argument provides base directory, which file browser cannot browser out of.  (problem during set!)
fixed file offset for browsing large directories
